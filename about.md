### Who are you? 

I'm you. More accurately, I'm the introspective, hyper-critical portion of your brain that you try to repress.

### Who are you really?

You'll be happy to know I have a day job â€” I work in engineering at a company you've heard of. If you really need to know more than that, you can subscribe to the highest tier of [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SoberingMirror) (you won't).

If you'd like me to continue making content, please share my work (with attribution). If you feel so compelled, you can also subscribe to my aforementioned [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/SoberingMirror) or make a [one-time donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=H9ZZJWAQHK6U4).
