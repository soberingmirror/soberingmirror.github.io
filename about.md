### Mission Statement

I create internet content for fun. I have a job – I make a good living as an engineer at a big tech company.

Given that, I've decided that **50% of the profits I make from Sobering Mirror (everything – ad revenue, Patreon, donations, future merch, etc.) will be donated to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.**

The other 50% will be reinvested into growing my online presence so that one day, hopefully, this will be a meaningful gesture.

All I ask is that you tell the various social media algorithms that my posts are worth spreading (assuming you actually think they're good). You can do that by following, liking, commenting, and sharing.
